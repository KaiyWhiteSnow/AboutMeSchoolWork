            The kid who would later be known as Kaiy, was once just an average kid, just making his first nick name to use<br>
            for the whole new world called "The internet". I wanted something close to my real name and something that sounds<br>
            cool. I decided for the name "JardexX" as the combination of my real name JÃ¡ra and game portal "FortexX Gaming".<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <p>
            This was the begining, a kid, a dream and a whole lot of mistakes to be made. JardexX is to this day the nemesis <br>
            of myself. It's a person that I am but no longer want to be. I created new nick name as an escape from my problems. <br>
            It was the name my older brother used on one of his accounts in Metin2 - WhiteSnow. It was the image of myself that <br>
            I wanted to be. Me who is not a cheater or untrust-worthy liar. However it wasn't long before I realised that I <br>
            cannot escape my past.

            So this was it. I have experienced my highs and lows and I was ready to face the reality. I can't escape what <br>
            I was and the last thing that remains is to find the middle ground. I was not perfect but I have learned. <br>
            So after nearly a year, I changed my nick name one last time. This time forever. I chose Kaiy as the <br>
            combination of Kay from my favourite show when I was a kid and "iY" to still keep myself reminded of <br>
            where I come from. Since then I learned to accept the reality of things and I managed to face myself, <br>
            regardless of what life threw at me.

            My profile picture actualy captures this progression of my life on the internet. A figure standing <br>
            on top of a hill, over looking the landscape. A tree Picea glauca "Sanders Blue" representing my <br>
            birth tree, giant cloud representing how great the world really is and most importantly the sun set. <br>
            The sun set represents the days which are now long gone. Quote "Even the sun sets alone" has much more <br>
            to uncover than what it may seem.
