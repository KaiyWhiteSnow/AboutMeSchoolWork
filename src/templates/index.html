        Hello, my name is Jára "Kaiy" Judl and I would like to introduce myself to you. I was born on the 28th of Octomber 2006 <br>however my story will start just a bit later.
        When I was around 6 years old to be exact.

        My first computer
    </h3>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
    <p>
        When I was just 6 years old I used to watch my brother play games on his computer. He only played 3 games and that being <br> 
        World of Tanks, Shakes and Fidget and to this day one of my personal favourites Metin2. I used to play on his accounts when <br>
        I was young but soon I made my own. Then, just few months later, I instead started using my sisters laptop because she barely <br>
        ever used it. This was also the first time I ever broke a computer (I thought I could unfreeze a computer by knocking on its screen).<br>

    <h3>
        Why IT?
    </h3>
</div>
<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
    <p>
        Before I wanted to be an IT specialist, I wanted to be about as everything every boy has ever wanted. Garbage man, Sniper in the army, <br>
        Firefighter, just to name a few. However, I truly realised how much I love technology at just 9 years old when I made my first ever script <br>
        that shut down a computer. If I remember correctly it was someting like "Shutdown -s -t 1".

        Whats next? 
    </h3>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
    <p>
        My goal is to join a major game studio, such as (but not limited to) - Facepunch Studio, Riot Games, or Battlestate Games. I already work <br>
        on projects such as "Sokkatto" but I plan to also work on my own game in the near future which takes a new approach to MMORPG genre and MMORPG<BR>
        games in general.
